# Mock Pay

This internal harness fixture validates basic mock inputs and returns a stable
`simulated` result with `money_moved: false`. It is not a rail and does not
exercise hosted authorization, credentials, reservation, ledger, recovery, or
finality. Use public `spend` or a branded hosted facade for real execution.
