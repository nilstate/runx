description: Canonical Runx skill-authoring implementation. Use for designing, creating, updating, improving, or adding harness coverage to a Runx skill package; it combines bounded agent judgment with native file writes, inspection, and safe harness validation. When a host skill-creator also triggers, use its general guidance but execute Runx work through this skill.

# Skill Lab

Build and improve Runx skills through one authoring surface. Keep judgment in
bounded agent acts and mechanics in native tools:

```text
inspect target files, catalog ownership, and native/shared tools
→ decide ownership, execution lanes, effects, budgets, and proof
→ bind that architecture to the inspected package digest in native code
→ compose existing capabilities before authoring code
→ author only bounded writes, explicit deletions, and output intent
→ bind those bytes to the admitted architecture in native code
→ validate paths, secret posture, and the complete candidate
→ inspect and safely replay the exact staged package
→ commit that validated bundle through one native transaction
```

Use the generic host `skill-creator` for platform-wide authoring guidance when
it is available. Do not reproduce Runx package operations from that guidance;
invoke the appropriate `skill-lab` runner so the work is bounded and receipted.

## Runners

- `design`: read-only catalog-fit and architecture planning. It returns a
  native digest-bound plan and never authors package bytes. A later build
  re-inspects and replans against its exact target before any write.
- `build` (default): create or update a package after its exact staged bundle
  passes native parsing, inspection, and safe harness replay.
- `improve`: turn one receipt or harness failure into a bounded package update,
  then validate and commit the exact staged bytes.
- `harness`: add fixture files to an existing package and replay the safe native
  harness against the exact candidate before committing it.

`build`, `improve`, and `harness` write local workspace files. They never
publish, install, push, or mutate an external provider. Native harness replay
runs with isolated Runx home, receipts, and no operator credentials. Invalid
staged packages stop before the target package is touched. Design, inspection,
validation, and the bounded transactional workspace write do not add a human
approval gate; the operator authorizes that reversible local mutation by
invoking the mutating runner. Publication, installation, provider effects, and
other consequential boundaries remain outside this skill and keep their own
approval rules.

A validated local write is not a published skill. For a shared or public
package, the validated `X.yaml` identity and the exact `target_dir` and
`package_digest` in `apply_result` form the publication candidate. When the
operator's objective includes shipping or registry availability, continue that
exact candidate through the repository's canonical registry operator: publish
under the intended existing owner/name, then independently read back the same
version and digest. Do not call the work shipped while that sync is pending or
unverified. Publication remains a separate authenticated act so Skill Lab
never receives registry credentials or hides a remote mutation inside local
authoring.

## Authoring rules

- Start from the operator's recurring job, not the requested package name,
  bounty wording, provider, or implementation sketch. Establish what becomes
  materially easier or newly possible for the operator, what judgment the
  skill contributes, and what durable result it returns. A package that merely
  restates ordinary agent behavior, renames one native call, or produces a
  document with no usable next step is not a valuable skill even when every
  contract and harness passes.
- Treat prior implementations, accepted bounty text, issue suggestions, and
  named integrations as evidence about the intended capability, not binding
  architecture. Preserve the real user outcome and compatibility obligations;
  replace stale ownership, unnecessary providers, and accidental workflow
  shapes when the current catalog has a cleaner canonical route.
- Treat `SKILL.md` as the product manual for both the human operator and the
  operating agent. A person opening it cold must understand what the capability
  does, why and when to use it, what happens end to end, and where it stops.
  Do not reduce that manual to terse model directives, field lists, or a task
  contract.
- Preserve the useful context in an existing skill: its mental model, procedure,
  examples, trade-offs, chain relationships, evidence rules, and recovery
  posture. Rewrite statements that no longer match the implementation; never
  delete the surrounding explanation merely because the executable profile now
  enforces part of it.
- A complete public skill explains, in a structure natural to the capability:
  the recurring job and outcome; when and when not to use it; the operating
  model and sequence; upstream and downstream skill relationships; meaningful
  input and output semantics; authority, approval, evidence, finality, and
  recovery; and relevant edge cases and stop conditions. Include a concrete
  example when it materially clarifies a non-obvious workflow. Do not force
  ceremonial sections onto a simple facade or internal rail.
- Put task-specific agent clauses after the human-readable operating guide.
  They sharpen individual agent acts; they do not replace the guide or carry
  the product's voice by themselves.
- Explain meaningful upstream and downstream skill relationships naturally in
  the operator guide. Do not maintain a second machine-readable dependency
  registry in `SKILL.md`: native execution-closure inspection owns the exact
  edge set and operator preflight surfaces it. Prose explains why the chain
  exists; the runtime proves what it actually calls.
- Design capability chains by responsibility, not by whichever integration is
  easiest to name:
  - The domain skill owns domain evidence, interpretation, policy, and the
    truthful domain result.
  - A canonical capability or authority skill owns a reusable decision such as
    authorizing a send, spending funds, or preparing a release.
  - A provider adapter owns the bounded external API effect and independent
    readback.
  Do not collapse these roles into one package, and do not make a provider
  adapter a required part of a provider-neutral capability. Pin an adapter only
  when the objective genuinely requires provider-specific behavior; otherwise
  return a stable handoff that an operator can route to the selected adapter.
  For example, a meeting skill may produce grounded task proposals and a
  follow-up message; communication then goes through `send-as`, while task
  creation goes through the operator's selected task adapter. n8n, Zapier, or
  any other automation provider is optional unless the requested capability is
  explicitly about that provider.
- Search the catalog by operator outcome and authority owner, not only by words
  present in the request. Consider every material result independently: a
  workflow may need different next lanes for a message, task proposal, payment,
  publication, or unresolved ambiguity. Reuse the canonical capability at each
  boundary and explain why it owns that decision. Do not hide an unhandled
  outcome behind a generic "handoff" claim.
- Preserve the context that makes the next operator or skill intelligent.
  Handoffs carry the bounded evidence, decision rationale, unresolved
  ambiguity, stable content or proposal, intended audience or target, and
  effect status needed by the next lane. Do not squash these into a digest,
  terse status, or provider payload. Digests bind context; they do not replace
  it. Conversely, do not forward unrelated source material or secrets.
- Make finality explicit at every boundary. Distinguish observed evidence,
  model interpretation, draft, proposal, authorized action, attempted effect,
  provider-confirmed effect, and independently read-back effect. A downstream
  route is not proof it ran; a sealed plan is not approval; an adapter request
  is not delivery. The public result and operator guide must say what actually
  happened and what still has to happen.
- A skill declares domain procedure and policy. Runx owns generic input,
  packet, evidence, approval, request, credential, effect, and receipt mechanics.
- Place the capability in its real owner before choosing an implementation.
  Reusable skills, end-user and domain-operator commands and UX, local host
  loops, local queues, and default local-state orchestration belong in Runx OSS
  or the owning product repository. `runx/cloud` is not precedent for those
  concerns: it may provide the hosted control plane, custody provider
  credentials, resolve authoritative grants, and execute a fixed bounded
  provider operation. Using Hosted Connect does not move the surrounding skill,
  procedure, operator decision, or state into Cloud. If that operator surface is
  missing, return work to OSS or the product owner; never extend a Cloud script
  or hosted service as a substitute.
- For hosted provider work, compose native `provider.read` or
  `provider.mutate`; declare exact scopes and provider operations, and require
  provider readback. `provider.mutate` owns the exact human approval at the
  effect boundary, so never add an adjacent graph approval for the same action.
  Use an explicit graph approval only for a consequential action whose native
  capability does not already own one. One action has one approval owner. Use
  `expected_result` to bind the returned resource identity and `result_fields`
  to admit only the fields the receipt needs. Secret-adjacent operations must
  project their result. Pass mutation retry identity through the native
  `idempotency_key` input; do not copy it into the provider payload. Never add a
  package token loader or request client.
- Never model human authority as a caller-supplied approval string, boolean, or
  reference. A native approval gate must summarize the exact target and effect;
  its host-attested packet is the only approval input a credentialed provider
  tool may accept. If a provider API requires its own approval reference, derive
  the claim- or resource-bound value inside that tool after verifying
  `approved: true`, `actor: human`, the exact gate id, and the action-specific
  gate type. An agent-authored `answers` value must fail before provider
  execution.
- `run: approval` is a human gate. Agent provenance is rejected by the runtime;
  use `agent-task` for model judgment and keep its result distinct from human
  authority.
- Treat the selected runner's typed execution requirements as the complete
  permission request. Put opaque scope strings, exact non-secret environment
  names, the named credential requirement, and runtime metadata on their
  canonical runner or source fields—never under `runx`, in prose, or in a
  package loader. Runx resolves and records those declarations without
  inventing a scope vocabulary; the native capability or provider that owns a
  scope enforces it.
- Make every public runner contract recursively complete at the authoring
  boundary. `X.yaml` owns nested properties, closed objects, enums, bounds,
  and complete parser-validated invocation examples; `runx skill inspect`,
  MCP, agent tools, and generated exports must project that same declaration.
  When an identical input declaration is used by multiple runners, define it
  once with the manifest's exact input-definition reference rather than copy
  it or invent merge overrides. JavaScript may enforce irreducible
  relationships between otherwise valid fields, but must not repeat structural
  validation already owned by the profile.
- Dogfood the result through the real agent-facing surface, not only the
  package harness. A cold agent must be able to inspect the selected runner,
  construct a valid call without reading source or fixtures, understand a
  path-specific rejection, and continue from the resulting context. Exercise
  every materially different runner; a default-only export cannot certify a
  multi-runner skill. For an existing target, use
  `authoring_context.target_inspection` as the canonical runner-contract and
  execution-closure evidence. An `invalid` inspection is repair context, not
  permission to guess: read the declared target files, correct the owning
  contract, and validate the complete candidate.
- Design evidence admission around the operator's job, not the first provider
  implementation. When analysis is useful over local admitted files or
  artifacts as well as remote sources, support both through their canonical
  evidence boundaries; do not require HTTPS, Hosted Connect, or another
  provider merely to analyze evidence already available on the operator's
  machine. Provider-specific acquisition remains a separate runner or upstream
  skill when it adds real readback value.
- Make permission claims executable through the existing package harness.
  Permission-bearing native and provider paths need a realistic admitted case
  and, where the harness can exercise that owner, a refusal case with the
  required scope or grant withheld. The harness must call the same catalog,
  dispatcher, and capability/provider implementation as a real run; never add
  a mock permission evaluator, scope vocabulary, or parallel verification
  report. This proves enforcement owned by Runx capabilities and providers. It
  cannot prove that trusted host code avoided undeclared filesystem, network,
  or syscall access, so report that boundary as trusted rather than confined.
- Tool fixtures inherit the exact scopes declared by the canonically resolved
  manifest and pass declared packets through the production packet verifier.
  Use `expect.output.matches_packet` only when the whole fixture output is one
  self-described packet; named artifact packets are already verified from the
  manifest and should not be asserted through a second fixture path.
- Search the inspected native-tool and skill catalogs before designing files.
  Prefer an existing core tool or canonical skill over executable package code.
- Make every public runner input constructible from inspection. Use ordinary
  `schema` for runner-owned nested values. When an input is exactly one
  canonical Runx packet, declare `type: json` plus `packet: <packet-id>` and
  let the runtime resolve the catalog-owned schema into inspection, validation,
  exports, registry bundles, and harnesses. Never copy that packet schema into
  the consumer. If the canonical schema is too weak to make the input usable,
  improve the producing packet contract first; a packet reference is not a
  substitute for a complete schema. Do not mint a packet id for a runner-local
  nested value, graph intermediate, or one-run implementation detail. A packet
  exists only for the complete value crossing a named reusable skill, runtime,
  SDK, provider, receipt, or registry boundary, and it must have one active
  producer and consumer or an explicit public native owner. Remove the generated
  artifact when that ownership disappears. Every public runner still needs at
  least one realistic, copy-valid example unless its inputs are empty.
- A named packet must expose its semantic fields or reference a canonical typed
  contract. Bare `type: object`, unconstrained `{}`, and opaque property bags do
  not make a runner inspectable and must be repaired at the producing contract,
  not documented around in prose. Open JSON is admissible only as an explicitly
  named protocol extension or generic data payload inside an otherwise bounded
  semantic envelope.
- Apply that rule recursively. Every nested `type: object` declares meaningful
  properties or an explicit `additionalProperties` policy. If the value is
  intentionally arbitrary JSON, declare `type: json`; do not make an object
  declaration imply structure that the contract does not provide.
- Put a producer's nested output shape in that output declaration's `schema`.
  Do not hand-maintain the same shape in a packet file, fixture, exporter, or
  consumer: native parsing, agent context, runtime validation, packet
  generation, registry packaging, and harness replay all consume the producer's
  declaration.
- Express orchestration through `X.yaml`; keep all static agent operating
  knowledge and task contracts in `SKILL.md`. Never put model instructions in
  manifests, fixtures, or duplicated prompt fragments.
- Declare every harness-only support file explicitly in `harness.files` using a
  normalized profile-relative path under `fixtures/`. Runx stages only those
  declared files into the isolated harness workspace; it never guesses
  dependencies from arbitrary input strings. Do not turn the declaration into
  a second source tree or include unconsumed helpers.
- Put every typed output and packet contract on the step that actually produces
  it. A graph runner is composition and its receipt proves that composition; it
  must not declare a second runner-level `outputs` or `artifacts` contract with
  ambiguous ownership. Every graph runner declares `graph.result_from` as the
  intentional public result boundary. Name the final provider readback or
  package/finalize step, not every leaf: approvals, evidence gathering, and
  intermediate writes remain available in operator context and receipts without
  polluting the result. Multiple producers are valid only for mutually exclusive
  branches or when their distinct contracts are intentionally returned together;
  simultaneous producers may not emit the same key. When a graph needs one
  public result, end it with an explicit package/finalize step and let that
  producer own the packet schema.
- Add executable code only for irreducible deterministic domain computation.
  Explain its domain boundary and why native tools plus a declarative graph
  cannot express it. Do not add code merely to transform Runx contracts.
- For a genuinely separate CLI or protocol tool, keep one canonical
  `manifest.json`. It owns source, inputs and defaults, artifact projection,
  scopes, retry/idempotency, and mutation metadata. Never persist generated
  `runtime`, `output`, `runx`, hash, or toolkit fields beside that contract.
  `runx tool build` validates and reports derived hashes without rewriting the
  package. The extension SDK may carry the already-materialized JSON request
  and response across a process boundary; it must not become a second manifest
  or input-contract owner. The declared entrypoint must execute on the
  repository's supported runtime without probing for generated files or
  importing uncompiled TypeScript. A bundled tool lives at
  `tools/<namespace>/<name>/manifest.json`, its dotted manifest name must match
  that path, and aggregate package admission must bind every static local
  source dependency before the package can run or publish.
- Local CLI tools, process MCP servers, and process adapters are trusted host
  code. Runx controls their exact invocation, delivered environment and
  credentials, lifecycle, bounded output, and evidence; it does not turn
  declared scopes into portable filesystem, network, or syscall confinement.
  Use this lane only when the operation is genuinely irreducible to native
  capabilities, provider adapters, declarative composition, or deterministic
  JavaScript. Never author a sandbox declaration, wrapper, or fallback flag.
- When that computation is JavaScript, use the native `type: javascript`
  source. Prefer one cohesive module named for the skill with focused named
  exports of the form `(inputs, context) => JSON`; split it only when the
  computations have genuinely separate ownership. Runx owns input delivery,
  output serialization, errors, wall limits, and isolation. Do not add fake
  operation inputs, Node command declarations, per-runner wrapper files, or
  stdout/environment plumbing. Pure JavaScript receives only its validated
  in-memory module bundle, JSON input, and a frozen
  `context.environment` object containing the exact names declared in the
  runner's `environment.required` and `environment.optional` lists. A missing
  required name stops before worker execution; an absent optional name is
  omitted. Values never enter the manifest, agent context, inspection output,
  or receipts. Environment declarations are for non-secret runtime
  configuration; credentials stay on the native credential/provider boundary.
  The worker process itself has an empty ambient environment and no workspace
  path, filesystem, network, clock, randomness, subprocess, credential, or
  provider surface. The default wall limit is two seconds; a runner may declare
  `timeout_seconds` from 1 through 30 when irreducible computation genuinely
  needs it. The worker is ECMAScript, not a browser: use the frozen
  `Runx.parseUrl(value)` helper for absolute URLs and do not assume Web or Node
  globals exist.
- Classify volume before authoring. Small typed control values belong in normal
  runner inputs; `runx skill --inputs` is only a bounded transport for one
  complete control object. Large immutable local content belongs behind
  `artifact.admit`/bounded pages. Durable history belongs behind
  `data.read_events` cursors or a compact projection. A graph must not carry an
  archive, growing event history, or completed-id array simply because one CLI
  call can parse it.
- Use deterministic `pages` only for irreducible record transforms over one
  admitted JSON-array artifact. The runtime owns artifact admission, page
  framing, snapshot digest, record boundaries, offsets, retries, and the page
  loop; the module owns only
  decoding and domain selection. Treat `runx_page.artifact_ref` as an opaque,
  runtime-local read capability that belongs in receipt provenance; never place
  it in a plan or idempotency digest. Bind deterministic domain output to
  `runx_page.whole_digest`, which is stable for identical content. Keep
  continuation state proportional to the bounded result. Do not add a package
  file reader, manual byte cursor, hashing loop, high-volume profile, or raised
  worker limit. If safe framing or bounded state is impossible, choose
  `needs_core` or a genuinely separate protocol tool rather than
  smuggling filesystem authority into JavaScript.
- Prove a volume path at two materially different scales through the production
  owner. The result must be identical across page sizes, cursors must advance,
  process count must stay stable where session reuse applies, and failures must
  remain distinguishable from empty pages. A larger fixture alone is not
  performance evidence.
- A missing generic primitive is not permission for package code. Return
  `needs_core` with no writes and identify either a runtime/security invariant
  or two independent existing consumers.
- Never add package-local raw `RUNX_INPUTS_*` parsing, generic packet or
  evidence hashing, packet wrapping, generic status construction, or provider
  simulation when a shared Runx boundary can own it. Package code may retain a
  canonical hash only when that hash is an intrinsic field of an established
  domain or wire protocol, not as a substitute for receipt or effect integrity.
  State that exception at the computation boundary.
- Keep packages concise: normally `SKILL.md`, `X.yaml`, and focused fixtures;
  add narrowly scoped references, assets, tools, or domain code only when consumed.
- Judge the whole capability, not proxy metrics. Native reuse, fewer files,
  shorter code, green harnesses, and low resource ceilings are valuable only
  when the result remains understandable, useful, truthful, and complete.
  Keep JavaScript when it performs irreducible domain computation; remove it
  when it reimplements runtime mechanics. Never trade away domain semantics or
  operator context merely to reduce line count.
- Keep shared computation DRY. A helper used by multiple skills belongs in its
  existing native owner or a justified shared primitive, never copied scripts.
- Count the whole replacement and delete displaced scripts, manifests, schemas,
  fixtures, and tests in the same change. Do not leave dual paths.
- Do not add package READMEs, changelogs, installation guides, strategy files,
  generated state, or credentials.
- Match the documented capability to the execution profile and truthful terminal
  state.
- Review the documentation diff for semantic loss. A shorter `SKILL.md` is an
  improvement only when the removed material was false, duplicated, or
  irrelevant and the remaining document still passes the cold-operator test.
- Treat the catalog's manual check as an anti-stub backstop, not a writing
  target. The structural title/section/prose floor does not prove a guide is
  substantive. Do not pad prose to satisfy a word floor or turn natural
  operating guidance into a template checklist.
- Prefer extending an existing owner over adding a near-duplicate skill.
- Preserve registry identity as part of capability ownership. Inspect the live
  registry before publishing a shared package; update the intended existing
  owner/name rather than creating a first-party neighbor beside an older name.
  Preserve an accepted contributor's namespace in the `registry_owner`
  field of `SKILL.md` frontmatter; absence means the Runx-owned `runx`
  namespace.
  A deliberate rename must migrate or retire the prior identity through the
  registry operator. Never transfer a contributor's community-owned row into
  the first-party namespace unless that ownership transfer is explicit.
- Treat registry portability as execution truth, not a publish-time smoke test.
  A local cross-package skill edge must be present in the digest-bound registry
  package bundle, and the publish harness must execute that exact materialized
  package. Never copy sibling source beside a harness while omitting it from the
  published artifact, rewrite the source graph for registry-only execution, or
  certify a package that needs the original checkout to run.
- Include a realistic happy path and refusal, stop, or error path.
- Never treat supplied agent answers as provider-effect proof.

Before admitting an architecture, perform a cold-operator trial against the
actual proposed result:

1. Can the operator tell what the skill concluded and which evidence supports
   it?
2. Can they distinguish missing or ambiguous information from a negative
   result?
3. Can they tell which effects happened, which are only proposed or
   authorized, and which remain unattempted?
4. Can they continue each material outcome through the correct canonical skill
   and the declared provider-selection boundary without reconstructing lost
   context?
5. Does one clear owner hold each decision, approval, mutation, and readback?
6. Would this still be the architecture chosen from scratch against the current
   Runx catalog?
7. Can a cold agent actually invoke every public runner from inspection alone,
   using local or remote evidence appropriate to the job, without source-diving,
   guessed JSON, or an unnecessary provider dependency?

If any answer is no, the package is not ready even if its schemas, tests, and
budgets pass. Fix the capability design or return `no_skill`/`needs_core`;
do not compensate with more fixtures, prose padding, or a bespoke wrapper.

## Outputs

- `architecture_decision`: the agent's closed ownership and execution design.
- `architecture_plan`: that decision bound by native code to the exact
  inspection digest. Design stops here.
- `change_draft`: package bytes and intent authored against the admitted plan;
  it contains no model-authored integrity values.
- `change_bundle`: the native, digest-bound transaction candidate produced from
  the plan and draft.
- `apply_result`: unchanged, needs-core, or validated-and-applied, with exact
  changed/deleted paths, package digest, focused proof, and line/file deltas.
  For a shared/public package, this is the exact local half of the registry
  publication handoff; registry publish and readback evidence remain separate.

## Inputs

- `objective` (required): capability or improvement to deliver.
- `package_name` (optional, build): explicit identity for a newly requested
  package; use it for `SKILL.md` and `X.yaml` even when the target directory has
  a different basename.
- `repo_root` (optional): workspace root; defaults to the caller workspace.
- `target_dir` (required for mutating runners): repo-relative package directory.
- `project_context` (optional): product, repository, and operator constraints.
- `receipt_id`, `receipt_summary`, `harness_output`, `failure_packet` (improve):
  failure evidence, including the stable packet from `review-receipt`.

## Agent task contracts

### `skill-lab-architecture`

Return exactly one `architecture_decision` using
`runx.skill.architecture_decision.v1`. Choose `build`, `extend_existing`,
`no_skill`, or `needs_core`. Explain the operator value and the manual's
knowledge contract: purpose, required evidence, decision logic, stop conditions,
and recovery. Assign every required behavior to exactly one real execution lane
(`manual`, `graph`, `agent_task`, `native_capability`, `domain_module`,
`cli_tool`, or `provider_adapter`). A native lane names a selected capability;
a domain module supplies a specific justification. Record inspected, selected,
and genuinely missing native capabilities; use `needs_core` only for a runtime
or security invariant or a primitive with two independent existing consumers.
When `package_name` is supplied, treat it as the requested package identity;
do not silently rename the package from its target path.

Declare effects, authority scopes, approval meaning, provider boundary, skill
routes, resource ceilings, preservation obligations, exact intended deletions,
and a proof plan. For every skill route, state the domain result being handed
off, the canonical capability or authority owner, whether a provider adapter is
required or operator-selected, the context that must survive the boundary, and
the truthful effect state before and after that route. Cover every material
outcome independently. Reject an unnecessary provider pin even when it appears
in prior work or the request's implementation sketch. Apply the cold-operator
trial to the proposed public result and chain before choosing a disposition.
Classify every potentially large value as control input,
immutable artifact, durable cursor/projection, or bounded domain result, and
name its production owner plus small/large proof. Reads, drafts, local
validation, and reversible package writes do not gain ceremonial human
approval. Provider mutations and other consequential effects keep their real
gates. Assign each consequential action exactly one approval owner; never pair
an explicit graph approval with an effect-owned approval for the same action.
Budgets are operational ceilings, not guesses to be widened after validation.
Do not write files, calculate a digest, invent provider proof, or solve an
ownership gap with package code.

For a shared/public package, also preserve its intended registry identity and
state whether registry availability is in scope. If it is, the plan ends local
authoring at the exact applied package and names the canonical registry
operator as the separate publish-and-readback boundary. Do not plan embedded
registry HTTP, credentials, auto-publish, or an adjacent owner/name.

For `improve`, diagnose only from supplied receipt or harness evidence and
distinguish contract, implementation, fixture, environment, and operator
failures. When evidence cannot justify a change, choose `extend_existing` and
let the author return `no_change`. For `harness`, plan fixture-only changes and
preserve all production behavior.

### `skill-lab-author`

Receive the exact native `architecture_plan` and return one `change_draft` using
`runx.skill.change_draft.v1`. Never copy or calculate `base_digest`,
`plan_digest`, architecture, or any other integrity field; native bind owns
those values. Choose `write`, `no_skill`, `no_change`, or `needs_core` in a way
that agrees with the plan. A non-write draft has empty `writes` and `deletes`.
A write contains the smallest complete target-relative file set, the exact
planned deletions, a truthful summary and non-goals, and the outputs the package
will actually produce.

When `package_name` is supplied, use it consistently in the `SKILL.md`
frontmatter and the `X.yaml` `skill` field. The directory is a placement
decision, not a second source of package identity.

Put static operating knowledge and task-specific agent rules in `SKILL.md` and
execution structure in `X.yaml`. Compose selected native capabilities and
declared skill routes first. Ensure the manual explains what each route is for,
what context crosses it, and what remains unperformed; do not substitute an
adapter name for that explanation. Add a domain module only when the architecture
admits it, and keep the module inside its stated computation boundary. Include
focused proof for a useful path and a stop, refusal, or regression path. In
`harness` mode, every write or delete must be under `fixtures/*.yaml`. Preserve
useful behavior and delete superseded implementation in the same draft. Never
add auxiliary docs, generated state, credentials, placeholder modules,
duplicated generic Runx mechanics, or an undeclared provider boundary.
Registry publication code, credentials, and live-state claims are likewise
outside the authored package; preserve only the canonical package identity
needed by the later registry operator.
