# Releasing the runx CLI

Maintainer doc. Most contributors do not need it.

## Identity

The CLI ships from `github.com/runxhq/runx`. Release tags are `cli-vX.Y.Z`
(prefixed so they do not collide with the repo's other release trains). In the
workspace, `release/status.json` is the operator source of truth for package
release status, the CLI package allowlist, and the cloud pin. The git tag is the
immutable OSS release event that the public workflow builds.

Release policy lives at the workspace root (`AGENTS.md` plus
`release/status.json`). This doc is the OSS maintainer runbook. If a release doc,
package manifest, cloud pin, or channel table disagrees with `release/status.json`,
fix the drift there and run the root checks; do not invent a second release flow.

The same product version is used on every active channel. The governed release
is verified only after independent readback from its required synchronous
channels:

- GitHub Release: `cli-vX.Y.Z` (the hub; serves the raw per-target archives)
- npm: `@runxhq/cli@X.Y.Z` (+ `@runxhq/cli-<platform>@X.Y.Z`)
- Docker (GHCR): `ghcr.io/runxhq/runx:X.Y.Z`, anonymously pullable
- Homebrew and Scoop: `X.Y.Z`

Winget is an asynchronous submission recorded separately after its pull request
exists. AUR is not an active Runx-owned channel while `runx-bin` belongs to
another maintainer; the generated manifest is only a handoff artifact. Neither
channel can silently weaken or block verification of the synchronous release
set.

The crates.io package is not a CLI release channel. `runx-cli` depends on the
internal Rust crate graph, whose versions move under a separate, explicit
library release. A CLI tag must not publish those libraries implicitly.

`runx --version` reports `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, so the crate and npm versions are
stamped from the tag at build time and the number is truthful regardless of how
the binary was installed.

## Versioning model

The source tree carries the reviewed CLI candidate version. The release profile
requires that committed version to match the requested release before approval;
the tag workflow then re-stamps and verifies the same value in each ephemeral
checkout. `cli-vX.Y.Z` is the CLI distribution version, not a workspace-wide
library-crate release. One command updates only the CLI package surfaces: npm
`package.json` + its `optionalDependencies`, `runx-cli`, the execution-runtime
release identity, and the `runx-cli` lockfile entry.

```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/set-release-version.ts X.Y.Z          # write
pnpm exec tsx scripts/set-release-version.ts --check X.Y.Z  # CI drift guard
```

It accepts a raw `cli-vX.Y.Z` / `vX.Y.Z` tag and strips the prefix.

CLI releases do not publish Cargo packages. `runx-cli` is stamped so the native
binary reports the same truthful version as the npm distribution, but its
internal Rust dependencies may be published only through a separately approved
library-crate release. Never cut a new patch just to repair a package-manager
manifest; repair the existing release asset, channel manifest, or workflow in
place.

## Pipeline

`.github/workflows/release.yml` fires on `cli-v*` tags. `workflow_dispatch`
(with a `version` input) runs a build + render dry-run with no publishing.

Stages (the order is intentional — the GitHub Release must exist before any
channel that downloads its archives):

1. **prepare** — resolve the version, stamp + `--check` manifests, `verify:fast`.
2. **build** (5-platform matrix) — resolve the matrix from
   `packages/cli/native/supported-platforms.json`, run the shared hostile-module
   contract on each native runner, then build `runx` and `runx-js-worker`
   together with the pinned toolchain. Per platform, package both executables
   into the signed npm artifact, raw archive, and Linux `.deb`, and record
   digest-bound worker evidence.
3. **smoke** (5-platform matrix) — downloads each built archive and runs
   the extracted `runx` beside its matching worker on the real OS. In addition
   to version and archive-shape checks, the packaged candidate must execute a
   nested signed-registry skill, pass declared workspace environment into
   frozen JavaScript context, deliver complete digest-bound `SKILL.md` context
   beyond one megabyte, preserve opaque scopes, close one human approval
   without a duplicate gate, and terminate active JavaScript work on
   interruption. Windows process-tree interruption remains covered by the
   dedicated Windows host-job lifecycle gate. A broken, incomplete, wrong-arch, or
   semantically incomplete archive fails before anything is published. The
   same smoke runs in dry-runs.
4. **github-release** — assemble `checksums.txt`, generate a CycloneDX SBOM, emit
   build-provenance attestations for the binaries, stage the install scripts, and
   publish the Release with all archives. This is the hub.
5. **publish-npm** — verify + publish the selector and native packages with npm
   provenance (`skip-existing`).
6. **package-managers** — build the channel input from the published checksums
   (`build-channel-input.mjs`), render Homebrew / Scoop / winget / AUR manifests
   (`gen-channel-manifests.ts`), verify them against the actual release archive
   contents (`check-channel-manifests.mjs`), and attach them to the Release.
7. **publish-{homebrew,scoop}** — update the required package-manager channels.
   **publish-winget** submits the validated `channels/winget/` manifest set
   asynchronously; it must not use a generator that guesses archive nesting.
   The AUR manifest remains a handoff artifact until Runx owns `runx-bin`.
8. **publish-docker** — multi-arch GHCR image (pulls the musl archive from the
   Release; no Rust toolchain in the image build).

GitHub Actions is deliberately disabled on the `winget-pkgs` fork. The fork only
hosts the PR head branch; the checks that gate a winget submission run on
`microsoft/winget-pkgs`. Upstream's workflows are written for that repo's
`pull_request_target` context, where spell check reads only the files a PR
touches. A push to a fork branch has no PR context, so the same workflow scans
the whole repository and fails on upstream's own vocabulary (`HKLM`, `UAC`,
`dsc`) no matter what the manifest contains. Leave Actions off; a red run there
is not a signal about the release.

## Installing (end users)

These work the moment a `cli-v*` tag ships, with no package-manager setup:

```sh
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL runx.ai/install | sh
```
```powershell
# Windows
irm runx.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

`runx.ai/install` and `runx.ai/install.ps1` are clean public paths that **proxy**
to the scripts in this repo ([scripts/install](../scripts/install) and
[scripts/install.ps1](../scripts/install.ps1) on `main`); the script bodies are
not duplicated on the site. Both detect OS/arch, download the matching archive
from the GitHub Release, verify its sha256, and install to a user bin dir.
Overrides: `RUNX_VERSION`, `RUNX_INSTALL_DIR`, `RUNX_BASE_URL` (private mirror).

The archive is one release unit: installers place `runx-js-worker` beside
`runx`, and deterministic-module execution fails closed if that
version-compatible worker is absent.

> Site proxy: point `runx.ai/install` → the raw `scripts/install` and
> `runx.ai/install.ps1` → raw `scripts/install.ps1` (302 or pass-through). Keep
> the path extensionless for the shell installer.

## Channel credentials

Missing credentials for the required synchronous channels fail publication or
independent verification. Optional asynchronous channels never masquerade as
verified release evidence.

| Secret | Channel | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | npm | required selector + native package publication |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` | Homebrew | required push to `runxhq/homebrew-tap` |
| `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN` | Scoop | required push to `runxhq/scoop-bucket` |
| `WINGET_TOKEN` | winget | optional asynchronous PR to `microsoft/winget-pkgs` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Release, GHCR | provided automatically |

Runx owns `runxhq/homebrew-tap` and `runxhq/scoop-bucket`. The winget package is
tracked through its upstream PR. Do not configure an AUR key for a package
owned by an unrelated maintainer.

## Cutting a release

```bash
# 1. Write release/notes/X.Y.Z.md with every required section and the exact
#    previous-tag comparison link, then validate it.
node scripts/check-runx-cli-release-notes.mjs --version X.Y.Z

# 2. On a clean OSS main commit, run the project-owned profile through the
#    canonical governed release lane. This prepares, obtains approval for, and
#    pushes the exact tag, then independently verifies every required channel.
runx skill skills/release release \
  -i project_root=. \
  -i profile_ref=release/runx-cli.json \
  -i channel=runx-cli \
  -i version=X.Y.Z \
  --json

# 3. After the release runner returns verified, add the reviewed release entry
#    to the Cloud changelog. From the workspace root, adopt the independently
#    verified release across status, Cloud's exact npm pin, lockfile, and notary.
pnpm release:adopt -- --version X.Y.Z
pnpm release:check
pnpm release:check:live
```

The release profile refuses a dirty checkout, a commit that differs from
`origin/main`, an exact candidate commit without successful `checks` and
`gitleaks` results, an existing tag bound to another commit, or a GHCR package
that is not anonymously pullable. It also requires a complete versioned
release-note file; the tag workflow publishes that exact reviewed body instead
of reconstructing a partial changelog from pull requests. Use
`workflow_dispatch` with a version only when a release-pipeline change needs a
no-publish matrix rehearsal. Do not duplicate the complete platform build for
an ordinary release: the governed tag publish starts the workflow that builds
and smokes every target.

Never move a published semver tag. Never bump a new patch just to repair channel
drift; fix the existing channel artifact or workflow unless the binary itself is
wrong.
