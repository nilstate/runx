# Security Authority Proof

Runx receipts must explain the authority boundary without becoming a secret
side channel. The compact policy projection lives under `authority_proof` and
validates against `runx.authority-proof.v1`. The adapter-observed execution
boundary is also copied into `receipt.authority.enforcement` before sealing, so
it is part of the signed receipt body rather than unsigned read metadata.

Allowed public fields:

- `run_id`, `skill_name`, and `source_type`
- requested connected-auth scopes and whether the skill declared mutating work
- scope admission status, granted scopes, grant id, and decision summary
- provider, connection id, grant reference, and `material_ref` hash
- typed execution-boundary observation and approval result
- redaction policy status

Banned fields:

- raw access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, passwords, client secrets, and
  provider credential bodies
- full private stdout or stderr bodies in public projections
- ambient environment dumps or unbounded local command logs
- unchecked provider output bodies in comments, public evidence, or ledgers

Credential material is represented by hashed opaque handles such as
`material_ref_hash`. Receipt writers still hash stdout and stderr, and metadata is
passed through the receipt redactor before signing. Hosted workers and local
runners use the same `authority_proof` schema name; consuming repos add policy
for source channels, assignees, and target repositories outside the core proof.
Local secret handoff is owned by the declared skill-credential contract and the
Rust `CredentialDelivery` boundary. Hosted provider execution continues to use
the credential-broker contract and opaque handles. In both paths, secret values
may cross only the trusted adapter/supervisor delivery channel, not authority
proofs, receipts, invocation metadata, adapter observations, or public provider
evidence. See [Credential Resolution](./credentials.md).

## Ownership Boundary

The Rust `AuthorityProof` wire structs and
`ExecutionBoundaryObservation` live in `runx-contracts`, which owns their
portable JSON shape and generated schemas. `runx-core` alone owns the policy
projection that constructs an authority proof from admission decisions. The
runtime adapter alone owns the observed execution-boundary value and binds it
into the receipt at seal time. Neither a skill nor an agent may self-attest that
observation.

The local runner applies authority in this order:

1. Manifest validation identifies the selected runner and its declared
   credential requirement.
2. The credential resolver selects one profile, project binding, hosted handle,
   or declared workspace source and constructs a redacted delivery.
3. Structural policy admission resolves the exact authority grant.
4. The adapter delivers only the resolved environment and credential material,
   executes through the lane's canonical boundary, and redacts captured output.
5. The signed receipt records the observed boundary, public observations, and
   output hashes without raw material.

## Provider-Permission Grants

`provider_permission` graph policy may declare required scopes, an expected
grant id, and the authority verb. It must not declare `granted_scopes`; granted
scopes come only from operator-carried runtime grant evidence.

Legacy provider-permission and MCP host steps fail closed unless the operator
supplies:

- `RUNX_PROVIDER_PERMISSION_GRANT_ID`
- `RUNX_PROVIDER_PERMISSION_GRANTED_SCOPES`, encoded as a JSON array of exact
  capability strings (for example `["repo.read","issues.write"]`)

Native `provider.read` and `provider.mutate` steps use the same evidence model
without requiring that setup in the common Connect path. They authenticate the
operator, read active grant metadata from Connect, and select the unique grant
whose provider and authoritative scopes cover the declared step. The selection
is cached for the run. No provider token or credential body crosses into the
skill. A host-injected native grant is a complete evidence tuple: the two
variables above plus `RUNX_PROVIDER_PERMISSION_PRINCIPAL_REF`. Partial tuples
never report ready.

The native boundary can also require exact `expected_result` identity fields
and project only declared `result_fields` before the result enters a receipt.
This prevents a correctly scoped call from being mistaken for the wrong
resource and keeps undeclared secret-adjacent material out of skill output.

When more than one active grant matches, resolution fails as ambiguous. Set
`RUNX_PROVIDER_PERMISSION_GRANT_ID` to select one; Runx then reads that grant's
current scopes from Connect. A host may inject the complete three-variable
tuple to carry already-resolved native grant evidence without a discovery call.

When a provider-permission effect is admitted, the sealed step receipt records
the operator grant as a typed `runx:grant:*` reference under
`receipt.authority.grant_refs`. The grant id is evidence of the authority that
admitted the effect; it is not a credential body and does not carry provider
token material.

## Hosted Payment Authority

OSS payment skills cross the same generic provider-permission effect boundary
as other hosted operations. Their receipts record the grant that admitted the
hosted call and the provider evidence returned to the graph. They do not prove
the private payment runtime's internal reservation or ledger state.

Runx Hosted owns payment-specific attenuation, aggregate caps, reservations,
single-use capabilities, idempotency, recovery, finality, and private ledger
state. A hosted payment operation must fail closed before calling a rail when
those checks cannot be proven. OSS never substitutes local effect state or a
caller-authored settlement claim for hosted admission and provider readback.

## Offline Receipt Verification

`runx verify [receipt-id] [--receipt-dir dir] [--receipt <path|->] [--json]`
re-checks sealed receipts from disk with no runtime or network dependency:
canonical body digests, content-addressed ids, linked-tree parent/child
integrity, scope adherence for privileged effects, and — when
`RUNX_RECEIPT_VERIFY_KID` and
`RUNX_RECEIPT_VERIFY_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64` are set — production Ed25519
signatures against the operator-trusted key. When those explicit verifier
variables are absent, a complete `RUNX_RECEIPT_SIGN_*` identity supplies its
own public verifier; explicit verifier configuration always takes precedence.
This lets the signing operator verify its own local store without duplicating
key configuration while independent verifiers need only the public key. Store
mode groups receipts into
trees by lineage; a chain that points at a receipt missing from the store is
reported as incomplete and fails verification. Single-receipt mode emits one
`runx.verify_verdict.v1` JSON verdict suitable for hosted notaries and other
embedding surfaces. Because a single document cannot prove tree membership,
lineage is reported as `unverified` without failing an otherwise valid
receipt. The command exits non-zero on invalid receipts, so it can gate
automation.

`fixtures/receipt-verify/` is the conformance corpus for machine consumers.
Every embedding surface that claims to verify a runx receipt must replay those
fixtures through the pinned `runx` binary and match the expected verdicts
instead of carrying a second verifier implementation in another language.

Scope adherence is intentionally pure and offline. Any act carrying typed
`EffectEvidence` without corresponding `receipt.authority.grant_refs` produces
`EffectGrantEvidenceMissing`, fails verification, and exits non-zero. This is
the boundary between a signed activity log and a governance proof: the receipt
must show both the privileged effect and the operator-granted authority that
admitted it.

## Operator Authority Diagnostics

`runx doctor authority [--json]` gives operators a redacted authority readiness
view before exercising privileged effects. It reports:

- receipt signer readiness, naming `RUNX_RECEIPT_SIGN_KID`,
  `RUNX_RECEIPT_SIGN_ED25519_SEED_BASE64`, and
  `RUNX_RECEIPT_SIGN_ISSUER_TYPE`
- receipt verification readiness and whether it resolves from the explicit
  `RUNX_RECEIPT_VERIFY_*` pair or the complete signing identity
- provider-permission grant readiness, reporting either authenticated Connect
  discovery or the complete host-injected `RUNX_PROVIDER_PERMISSION_GRANT_ID`,
  JSON-array `RUNX_PROVIDER_PERMISSION_GRANTED_SCOPES`, and
  `RUNX_PROVIDER_PERMISSION_PRINCIPAL_REF` path

The diagnostic may show key ids and resolved filesystem paths. It must not show
signing seeds, public key material, provider scope values, grant ids, or
credential bodies.
